# Arabic Reader with Integrated Root-Based Dictionary
The Arabic Reader is a comprehensive solution created specifically for non-native Arabic readers, comprising of two distinct components: a reading application and a root-based dictionary web service. By integrating these two separate applications via an API, the reader will be able to easily look up root-based definitions of unknown words without having to open a separate dictionary. This provides an uninterrupted and in-depth learning experience, enabling readers to seamlessly incorporate new vocabulary and concepts into their reading practice.
